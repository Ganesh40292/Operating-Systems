## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a practical reference for understanding Operating Systems concepts using C programming.  
It focuses on algorithm implementation and logical understanding of OS mechanisms.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- GCC Compiler  
- Any C IDE or Terminal  
- Basic knowledge of C programming  

---

## 📂 Organization

For better clarity and maintainability, programs can be organized topic-wise into the following categories:

- Scheduling  
- Synchronization  
- Deadlock  
- Memory Management  
- Page Replacement  
- File Systems  

This structure helps in easy navigation and logical grouping of related programs.
